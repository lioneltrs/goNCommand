## Installation

Put these files in a directory of your choice:

    go*
    ss_unswizzle.c

Then compile ss_unswizzle.c:

    gcc -o ss_unswizzle ss_unswizzle.c

## Usage
1. Set the path MY_RAW_ROMS_DIR to point to the directory where Ninja Commando (or another supported game) is installed. In this directory, you will see files such as c1.bin and m1.bin. Example :

    MY_RAW_ROMS_DIR=/home/lionel2/provi/amazon/ninja_commando/rom

2. Set the path MY_OUT_ROM_DIR_1 to a temporary directory of your choice.
3. Run one of the eight scripts: 

```
./goNCommand
```
or
```
./goGPilots
```
or ./goAoF3 or ./goML or ./goNM or ./goCS or ./goSengoku or ./goSuperS or ./goLB2 or ./goRA or ./goSS4_a or /goLR.

You should get a ncommand.zip file (or gpilots.zip, or aof3.zip, or maglord.zip, or ninjamas.zip, or crsword.zip, or sengoku.zip, or ssideki.zip, or  lastbld2.zip, or roboarmy.zip, or samsho4.zip, or lresort.zip) in the directory where the script is.

## Background and information
The C code ss_unswizzle.c was written by ark (the script goNCommand links to the original post where I found it).

The script goNCommand creates all but one file that match FBNeo CRC32. The file 050-p1.p1 does not match the CRC32 given by FBNeo, and I do not know how to fix this, as it is a simple copy of the original file. The game seems to run fine: feel free to investigate.

Update: a friend noticed that 050-p1.p1 differs from the "known" file only at one address. I updated all the scripts, as it seems to be the case for all of them.

Thank you to contributors Lx32, RedundantCich for theirs scripts.
